# About the project
This repository keeps a Data Engineering project that aims to gather data from Braziian economic landscape. Initially, most of data is about companies which are listed on B3 (Brasil, Bolsa, Balc√£o).

# Project outline
The project consists of collecting data using python applications and writting it on S3 **datalake**, then making needed **data cleaning** and **tranformations**. Once data is available on datalake, it is transformed into a **Data Lake House** by using **Delta** and **Pyspark**. The whole enviroment will be based on **Docker** containers orchestrated by **kubernetes operators** in **Airflow**.
